Update pypilot code
###################

The |PYautopilot| *OpenPlotter Pypilot* app always installs the latest version of Pypilot but it may happen that the Pypilot code is updated later. To update the Pypilot code simply reinstall the |PYautopilot| *OpenPlotter Pypilot* app from the |mSettings| *OpenPlotter Settings* and the installer will perform all necessary tasks keeping the current settings.

.. important::
	Pypilot is a complex environment and you will find many tutorials with instructions for installing programs, editing configuration files or executing commands in the terminal. You do not need to do any of this in OpenPlotter because you can control Pypilot completely from its graphical interface.

.. danger::
	This workbook is perhaps the most comprehensive document on Pypilot, but beware! contains a lot of outdated information about OpenPlotter v2 and some instructions that are no longer needed in OpenPlotter v3 and could make your system unstable.
