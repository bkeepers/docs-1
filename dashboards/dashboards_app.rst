Node-Red Dashboard
##################

.. image:: img/nodered_dashboard.png

`Node-RED <https://nodered.org/>`_ is a tool that uses a browser-based visual editor to program the connections between hardware devices, and APIs such as Signal K. It allows you to gather, adjust, enhance and deliver the data without needing to understand complex programming languages such as C or Python.

In OpenPlotter, Node-RED is embedded in the Signal K server as a plugin, and contains some specific nodes to manage Signal K data. Go to the plugin homepage to see the list of nodes and some examples: https://github.com/SignalK/node-red-embedded

The installation also includes the node-red-dashboard plugin that adds more nodes for creating buttons, graphs, gauges, sliders, and so on.

You can build Node-RED dashboards by selecting *Node-Red Dashboard* in the list and clicking |DBedit| ``Edit`` or by typing this adddress in your local browser: *http://localhost:3000/plugins/signalk-node-red/redAdmin/*. You can also connect to this page from any device connected to the same network as OpenPlotter using the address *http://openplotter.local:3000/plugins/signalk-node-red/redAdmin/*.

You can see your Node-RED dashboards in action by selecting *Node-Red Dashboard* in the list and clicking |DBshow| ``Open`` or by typing this adddress in your local browser: *http://localhost:3000/plugins/signalk-node-red/redApi/ui/*. You can also connect to this page from any device connected to the same network as OpenPlotter using the address *http://openplotter.local:3000/plugins/signalk-node-red/redApi/ui/*.

Using and learning Node-RED takes some time and is not the goal of this document. If you are not a programmer but would like to learn some basic principles, Node-RED is the perfect starting point. Everything will be possible in OpenPlotter using Node-RED.
